## Introduction
Six beamforming-based approaches for construction equipment sound source separation are implemented and evaluated using real construction job site data. The results show that Frost beamformer and time-delay Linear Constraint Minimum Variance (LCMV) generate outputs with array gains of more than 4.0, which are more reliable for audio-based equipment activity recognition.

## Programming Language Used
MATLAB

## Guide to folders and files
Codes are explained as follows:
1. **Main file** (EquipmentBeamformers.m): This is the main file to execute.
2. **Inputs:**
  Three types of equipment and each equipment has Two .WAV files (equipment sound collected on the job site using a microphone array)
  1. BIGD9GBulldozer (_den: means denoised sound)
  2. Excavator (_den: means denoised sound)
  3. Jackhammer (_den: means denoised sound)
